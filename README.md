# Task Tracker App

A simple app for tracking things to do! Built with Angular 12 for experimental purposes.

## Features

- List view of all tasks added
- Persistent storage of tasks added to the list
- Add new tasks with the date/time and reminder option
- Delete tasks when completed

## Usage

1. Start up fake [JSON server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server) by running `npm run server` to simulate backend database for testing. Data is actually stored in _db.json_. You may need to install it via npm first.
2. Run `ng serve` to start the app dev server at `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Coming Soon...

- Persistent storage in the cloud
- User accounts to store tasks
- UI redesign
- Option to "complete" the task as well as deleting
